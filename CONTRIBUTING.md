# Contributing

This repository contains my PhD research framework for **Meta-Learning for Cross-Domain Multi-Fidelity Optimization**.

---

## 🎓 Current Status

This framework is currently in development as part of my PhD research (2025-2029) at [University Name - to be determined].

The repository contains:
- Research framework structure
- Code templates for 5 research questions
- Experiment scripts for 4 validation domains
- Documentation of methodology and validation plan

---

## 🚧 Development Phase

**Current Phase:** Research Framework (Pre-PhD)

All code is marked as "To be implemented during PhD" where appropriate. This demonstrates:
- ✅ Understanding of the research area
- ✅ Technical preparation and planning
- ✅ Organized approach to the PhD
- ✅ Clear roadmap for implementation

## 🎯 **DECISION FLOWCHART**
```
Do I need to change .gitignore?
    │
    ├─→ GitHub created it with "Python" template?
    │   └─→ YES! ✅ Don't change it! Already perfect!
    │
    └─→ Want to add extra ignores for research?
        └─→ Optional ⭐ 2 minutes to add extras


Do I need CONTRIBUTING.md?
    │
    ├─→ Required for PhD application?
    │   └─→ NO! ❌ Completely optional
    │
    ├─→ Do I have 2 extra minutes?
    │   └─→ YES? ✅ Create it (looks professional)
    │   └─→ NO? ✅ Skip it (repository works fine)
    │
    └─→ Want to look extra professional?
        └─→ YES ⭐ Create it!
        └─→ NO ✅ Skip it!
```

## ✅ **MY RECOMMENDATION**

### **For .gitignore:**
**✅ DO NOTHING!**
- GitHub's default Python .gitignore is excellent
- Already covers everything you need
- Save yourself 2 minutes!

### **For CONTRIBUTING.md:**
**⭐ CREATE IT IF YOU HAVE TIME**
- Takes only 3 minutes
- Makes repository look complete
- Shows long-term thinking
- **But if you're rushing:** Skip it! Not essential!

## 📊 **IMPACT ANALYSIS**

| Action | Time | Impact on Application | Recommended? |
|--------|------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Edit .gitignore** | 2 min | 0% (already good) | ❌ Skip |
| **Create CONTRIBUTING.md** | 3 min | +2% (nice touch) | ⭐ Optional |

**Bottom line:** Neither is required, both are optional polish!

---

## 🚀 **PRIORITY GUIDE**

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Must Do):**
1. ✅ Main README.md
2. ✅ All src/ code files
3. ✅ All experiments/ files
4. ✅ All docs/ files
5. ✅ All data/ files
6. ✅ All tests/ files
7. ✅ requirements.txt
8. ✅ setup.py

```
⭐ Add extra lines to .gitignore (optional polish)
⭐ Create CONTRIBUTING.md (optional polish)
→ Repository looks 100% complete!
